# Use Case: Air Quality Monitoring
## How do our measured values impact air quality?

1. Temperature: Higher temperatures can accelerate the formation of ground-level ozone and increase chemical reactions that impact pollutant concentrations.
-> Higher Temperature means higher pollutant concentrations

2. Air pressure: Changes in air pressure affect the dispersion and concentration of pollutants, with high-pressure systems trapping pollutants and low-pressure systems aiding dispersion.
-> low pressure = wet and windy conditions wash pollutants away
-> high pressure = air stops moving results in pollutants concentrating over an area

3. Humidity: Humidity has an impact on the formation and dispersion of air pollutants. Humid air traps pollutants close to the ground, preventing them from dispersing into the atmosphere. This increases the concentrations of pollutants in the air, especially in urban areas.

4. Sunshine: Sunshine can cause some pollutants to chemically react, resulting in higher pollutant concentration
